# Java Color Interpolator

WORK IN PROGRESS

This program is designed to allow for experimentation with colors and how their RGBA values interact. On launch, the window will show a rectangle with four colors - red, grene, blue, and yellow - and by clicking on the corners, the user can edit the RGB values in each corner. The rectangle will automatically update all values in between the corners to be accurate interpolations of all colors.

The program will include space to write additional interpolation algorithms - the default will be a nonrecursive X, then Y interpolation pattern.
